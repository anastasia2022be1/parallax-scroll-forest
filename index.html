                <strong>Forest Parallax</strong> is a modern scrolling animation
                that demonstrates how to create a depth illusion using only
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no frameworks or external libraries
                involved.
              </p>

              <p>
                The page includes layered visuals: distant mountains, multiple tree
                levels, and birds flying in the foreground. Each element moves
                at a different speed, making the scene feel immersive.
              </p>

              <p>
                The project uses scroll-based motion, calculated dynamically
                based on your screen size. The effect stays consistent across
                large desktops and smaller mobile devices thanks to adaptive
                scaling logic.
              </p>

              <p>
                To ensure smooth performance, the animations are optimized using
                <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. This method aligns layer
                movements with the browserâ€™s refresh cycle, preventing lags or
                jittery transitions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each forest layer is built using a
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with a unique background image.
                The transformation logic includes <code>translate3d</code> and
                <code>scale()</code>, making each layer not only move but also
                subtly grow or shrink to enhance the illusion of depth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon page load, a soft animation is triggered: trees slide in
                from below, and birds fly in from the sides. This creates a
                welcoming entrance effect and makes the interface feel alive
                from the very beginning.
              </p>

              <p>
                The design is fully responsive. All measurements are made using
                relative units like percentages and viewport values. The layers
                keep their proportions and behavior on any device size or screen
                ratio.
              </p>

              <p>
                This parallax effect can be reused in portfolios, landing pages,
                or storytelling sites. Itâ€™s lightweight, educational, and a good
                starting point for experimenting with scroll-based
                interactivity.
              </p>

              <p>
                The project follows a simple and clear file structure,
                separating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images into dedicated
                folders. It's easy to clone, edit, and expand.
