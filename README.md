# Forest Parallax

**Forest Parallax** is a lightweight parallax scrolling effect built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases how layered backgrounds (mountains, trees, birds) can move at different speeds to simulate depth and perspective.

## Features

- Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS (no libraries)
- Scroll-based animation with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Adaptive animation speed based on screen size
- Layered scene: mountains, forest, birds
- Clean structure and reusable logic


## How It Works

As the user scrolls down, JavaScript calculates a `finalPosition` value depending on the scroll position and screen height. This value determines how each layer transforms using `translate3d` and `scale`. The animation is smooth and efficient thanks to `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Use Cases

- Landing pages
- Visual storytelling
- UI experiments
- Portfolio animation effects

Enjoy the forest! 🌲🌿🕊️
